# Complex Maze Solver

Difficulty: 9/10

## Scenario:

You are tasked with creating a program to solve a complex, multi-dimensional maze. The maze is represented as a hypercube, where each cell can be connected to multiple other cells in various dimensions. Your goal is to find the shortest path from the start to the end, navigating through this intricate structure.

## Instructions:

- Implement a function `solve_maze(maze, start, end)` that takes three parameters:
  - `maze`: A data structure representing the hypercube maze
  - `start`: The starting coordinates in the maze
  - `end`: The ending coordinates in the maze
- The maze is represented as a dictionary where each key is a tuple of coordinates, and the value is a list of connected coordinates
- Your function should return the shortest path from `start` to `end` as a list of coordinates
- If no path exists, return `None` or an empty list (depending on your language convention)
- Implement an efficient algorithm that can handle large, complex mazes
- Your solution should work for mazes of any dimension (2D, 3D, 4D, etc.)
- Optimize for both time and space complexity

## Test Cases:

```
maze1 = {(0,0): [(0,1), (1,0)], (0,1): [(0,0), (0,2)], (0,2): [(0,1), (1,2)], (1,0): [(0,0), (2,0)], (1,2): [(0,2), (2,2)], (2,0): [(1,0), (2,1)], (2,1): [(2,0), (2,2)], (2,2): [(1,2), (2,1)]}
solve_maze(maze1, (0,0), (2,2)) == [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)]

maze2 = {(0,0,0): [(0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0)], (0,0,1): [(0,0,0), (0,1,1)], (0,1,0): [(0,0,0), (1,1,0)], (0,1,1): [(0,0,1), (1,1,1)], (1,0,0): [(0,0,0), (1,1,0)], (1,1,0): [(0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,1)], (1,1,1): [(0,1,1), (1,1,0)]}
solve_maze(maze2, (0,0,0), (1,1,1)) == [(0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)]

maze3 = {(0,0): [(0,1)], (0,1): [(0,0), (1,1)], (1,1): [(0,1)]}
solve_maze(maze3, (0,0), (1,0)) == None  # or [] depending on language convention

maze4 = {(0,0,0,0): [(0,0,0,1), (0,0,1,0), (0,1,0,0), (1,0,0,0)], (0,0,0,1): [(0,0,0,0), (1,1,1,1)], (0,0,1,0): [(0,0,0,0)], (0,1,0,0): [(0,0,0,0)], (1,0,0,0): [(0,0,0,0)], (1,1,1,1): [(0,0,0,1)]}
solve_maze(maze4, (0,0,0,0), (1,1,1,1)) == [(0,0,0,0), (0,0,0,1), (1,1,1,1)]

large_maze = {(i,j,k): [(i+1,j,k), (i,j+1,k), (i,j,k+1)] for i in range(99) for j in range(99) for k in range(99)}
len(solve_maze(large_maze, (0,0,0), (98,98,98))) == 294

cyclic_maze = {(i): [(i+1) % 1000000] for i in range(1000000)}
solve_maze(cyclic_maze, 0, 999999) == list(range(1000000))

disconnected_maze = {(i): [(i+1)] for i in range(500000)} | {(i): [(i+1)] for i in range(500001, 1000000)}
solve_maze(disconnected_maze, 0, 999999) == None  # or [] depending on language convention
