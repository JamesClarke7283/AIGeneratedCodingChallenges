# AI Generated Coding Challenges
This project aims to challenge people by what AI thinks is difficult. I will be using the most capable LLMs to design these challenges to test myself.

The constraint on the user is they are allowed to use a LLM, but only for specific questions about documentation, etc.
Not to give direct solutions.

Extra points are given for solutions which improve on performance.

## Instructions for the AI to generate a challenge
```
Write me a hard coding challenge that is language agnostic, write me a [CHALLENGE_NAME].md

It must include the sections:

# [Title]

Difficulty: (number out of 10)

## Scenario:

[describe the scenario]

## Instructions

[bullet point instructions on what the task is]

## Test Cases (language agnostic, user must write tests in the language they specify)

[test 1] == X

[test 2] == X

[test 3] != X

[test 4] === X

[test 5] < X

[test 6] > X

[test 7] ...etc
```
